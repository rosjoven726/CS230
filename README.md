Summary of The Gaming Room Client and Software Requirements:
The client, The Gaming Room, is a gaming lounge that wanted software to manage their
customers and the games they play. They needed an application that could track the game 
reservations, handle customer profiles, and generate reports on popular games. 
The software had to be user-friendly, scalable, and capable of integrating with their 
existing systems. I designed a solution that meets these needs by creating a system
that allows users to book game sessions, view game information, and manage customer 
data in real time.

What I Did Particularly Well in Developing This Documentation:

I believe I did well in organizing the document in a clear and logical manner.
Each section, from requirements gathering to the system architecture, flowed well and 
provided a detailed overview of the software design. The use of diagrams to illustrate
the system’s structure, along with the inclusion of both functional and non-functional requirements,
helped to communicate the design effectively to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

What I Found Helpful in Developing the Code:

The process of working through the design document helped me identify potential challenges
early on, such as how to handle concurrency when multiple users reserve gaming stations. 
This foresight made the coding process smoother, as I already had a clear understanding of 
the system’s logic and how it would interact with the database. It also helped me ensure that 
the code would meet the client's needs without unnecessary features or complications.

What I Would Revise:

If I could revise one part of my work, I would focus on refining the use case scenarios.
While I addressed the major functionality, I think I could have provided more detail on 
edge cases, such as handling a situation where a reservation is attempted for a fully booked 
time slot. Anticipating these exceptions early in the design process would improve the 
software's robustness.

Interpreting the User’s Needs and Implementing Them:

When interpreting the user’s needs, I made sure to focus on ease of use and simplicity.
Since The Gaming Room deals with customers who may not be tech-savvy, it was essential to 
design an intuitive interface. I kept the user experience in mind by ensuring features like
game reservation and profile management were straightforward and accessible. Considering
the user’s needs is crucial because it ensures the software will be adopted and effectively
used by the target audience.

Approach to Designing Software:

I approached the software design using a combination of iterative design and feedback loops.
I started by gathering detailed requirements from the client and then created wireframes and
flowcharts to outline the user interface and system interactions. I also used object-oriented
design principles to model the application’s structure. For future projects, I would continue
using this approach but incorporate more user testing during the early design stages to ensure
the software is user-friendly from the outset.
